  <h1>I'm Fernando GÃ³mez</h1>
  <h3>Front End Developer</h3>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m a <strong>developer passionate</strong> about building accessible interfaces
    where meticulous design meets robust engineering. What excites me most is working
    at the intersection of design and codeâ€”crafting experiences that are not only
    visually engaging but also optimized for performance and usability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I'm a university student pursuing my degree in systems
    engineering. Once I graduate, I plan to specialize in front-end development
    and continue sharpening my skills to build even more impactful digital
    experiences
  </p>
  <p>
    In the past, I had the opportunity to work at DevPro, where I gained
    hands-on experience with tools like Angular, React JS, Jira, Trello, GitHub,
    Tailwind CSS, Sass, and more. This experience helped me strengthen my
    technical abilities and collaborate effectively in agile environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy many thingsâ€”playing the drums, learning new skills,
    reading, gaming, and staying active through sports.
