  <h1>I'm Fernando GÃ³mez</h1>
  <h3>Front End Developer</h3>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m a <strong>developer passionate</strong> about building accessible interfaces where
    meticulous design meets robust engineering. What excites me most is working
    at the intersection of design and codeâ€”crafting experiences that are not
    only visually engaging but also optimized for performance and usability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond coding, I love learning new things, getting lost in a good book,
    spending time with loved ones, or unlocking the latest Brawl Stars
    characters.
